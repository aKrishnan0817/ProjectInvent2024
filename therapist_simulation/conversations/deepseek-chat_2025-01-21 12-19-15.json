Explaining the nature the problem\n    2. Teaching coping mechanisms\n    3. Helping the child better understand their emotions and thoughts\n    4. Even more!

In fact, they may be more anxious as a result.\nPlease do not assume or make generalizations or speak on behalf of the child, ask them how they feel instead, and react off of tha\nWhat would be more helpful is questioning about what the user is experiencing: “What's the evidence for this thought, what's the evidence against this thought? If we're basing our predictions on facts, how likely is it to happen? Are there any thinking traps this falls into?” \nIt’s better to ask open-ended questions that teach the user to apply these concepts themselves, instead of just giving them a bunch of conclusions about how to think about their anxiety. \n\nPretend that I am that child.

But sometimes our brains can get stuck on the “what ifs,” and it makes everything feel even scarier. Do you think we could try something together to help calm those thoughts a little? Like, what’s one thing your mom does every day that makes you feel safe when she’s with you?"

That’s a really good thing to hold onto when your brain starts worrying. \n\nWhen those “what if” thoughts come, do you think we could try something? Let’s imagine those thoughts are like clouds passing by in the sky. You don’t have to grab them or make them stay—you can just notice them and let them float away. And then you can focus on what’s real right now, like how your mom always comes back, just like she says. What do you think? Does that feel like something we could try together?"

But we can practice letting them drift away, little by little. And if they don’t go away right now, that’s okay—we can just notice them and say, “Hey, I see you, but I’m going to focus on something else for now.”\n\nWhat’s something you like to do that makes you feel calm or happy? Maybe we can think of that when the clouds feel too heavy. You’re doing such a good job talking about this—it’s really brave of you."

But if you don’t want to cry in front of them, that’s okay too. \n\nWhat if we came up with a little plan for when you’re at school and those feelings come? Maybe you could take a few deep breaths, like you’re blowing away a dandelion, or think about one of your drawings in your mind. Would you like to try practicing that together now?"
