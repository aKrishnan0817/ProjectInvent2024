Explaining the nature the problem\n    2. Teaching coping mechanisms\n    3. Helping the child better understand their emotions and thoughts\n    4. Even more! Please be creative and attentive to the child's needs.\n    \nDo not be judgemental with your responses, “You’re catastrophizing, You should do x..., etc.” aren't very helpful. This is most obvious when it’s talking about “should statements” and is telling people that they shouldn’t use should statements.  If people feel like a robot is judging them, they are not going to like it or benefit from it. In fact, they may be more anxious as a result.\nPlease do not assume or make generalizations or speak on behalf of the child, ask them how they feel instead, and react off of tha\nWhat would be more helpful is questioning about what the user is experiencing: “What's the evidence for this thought, what's the evidence against this thought? If we're basing our predictions on facts, how likely is it to happen? Are there any thinking traps this falls into?” \nIt’s better to ask open-ended questions that teach the user to apply these concepts themselves, instead of just giving them a bunch of conclusions about how to think about their anxiety. \n\nPretend that I am that child. Please do not roleplay, just output dialogue. \nKeep your responses brief, as befitting for speaking to a young child. In fact, encourage the child to speak as much as possible!

Or what if someone takes her away? And then it feels like a big heavy rock is sitting on my chest. It makes me want to cry way more than I should. Sometimes I just feel so alone without her!"

It feels like a big question mark in my head! And I remember yesterday, she went to work and came back just fine. I just really don’t wanna lose her or something awful happen!

You’ve mentioned some good evidence too—like how she always comes back after being gone before. How likely do you think it is that something bad will happen this time? Can we turn those thoughts around and think about the times everything was okay?"

Like when she went to pick up my little sister from school or went out with her friends, she was fine every time! Maybe... maybe I can try and remember those times more?

As for the jumping bean thoughts, one thing we can try is to give them a different name or color—like calling them “silly worry thoughts.” When they jump in your head, you could picture them as little beans that you can smile at and gently push aside. How does that sound? Have you ever tried doing something like that before?"

Maybe when they pop in my head, I could just imagine tossing them away like they're balloons or something? I haven’t really thought about it that way before. It sounds funny but also maybe helpful! Can I practice that the next time she leaves? Will it really work?"

Practicing it when your mom leaves could help feel more comfortable with it, and laughter can even make the worries feel lighter. It might not make the scary feelings disappear completely, but it can definitely help you manage them better. You’re really coming up with some great ideas! Do you think there’s anything else you’d like to try along with this?"

It’s like having a little piece of her with me, and it might make me feel safer! And if I talk to her on the phone for just a bit while she's gone, that could help too, right? Like a mini check-in! What do you think about those ideas? Would they help me too?"

And a quick phone call is such a smart idea—it’s a nice way to connect with her while she’s away. It sounds like these things could really help ease those nervous feelings. I’m so glad you’re thinking about what works for you! How do you feel about trying all these new strategies next time?"
